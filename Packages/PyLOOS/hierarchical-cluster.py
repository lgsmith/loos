    Perform hierarchical clustering given a matrix of distances

    Summary of Arguments
      rmsd_file :     matlab-format text file containing "distances" between all
                      observations.  For example, this could be the output of 
                      the LOOS program rmsds
      num_clusters:   number of clusters to truncate the clustering

    Optional arguments
      --index_file    text file containing a list of filenames and which rows 
                      of the rmsd_file they correspond to.
                      The format is: 
                      START_FRAME    END_FRAME    FILENAME
                      using 0-based indexing.  This could be useful if you 
                      passed multiple trajectories to rmsds, but now want to 
                      pull out the cluster populations for each individual 
                      trajectory.
    --prefix          name to use for the outputted time series and histogram.  
                      --prefix "foo" produces "foo.dat" and "foo.hist"
    --link            writes out the linkage matrix to "all.link" or the 
                      equivalent name if you supplied a --prefix.

    Output
    If you did not pass in an index file or a prefix, this program will produce 
    2 output files, "all.dat" and "all.hist".  "all.dat" contains the time 
    series of cluster assignments, while "all.hist" is a normalized histogram of 
    cluster populations.  If you supplied a "--prefix" argument, that string 
    will replace "all" in the .dat and .hist filenames.

    If you did supply an index file, it will additionally supply a .dat and 
    .hist for each file listed in the index file.  It will strip off any 
    leading path and anything that looks like a filename extension, so that
    "/foo/bar/baz.dcd" would produce "baz.dat" and "baz.hist".

    Technical Details

    This program is mostly a thin wrapper around scipy's hierarchical clustering
    routines.  It uses the UPGMA algorithm: when trying to decide whether to 
    merge 2 clusters, it takes the average of the distances between all pairs of 
    points in the 2 clusters.  Because we supply a distance matrix instead of 
    the actual data points (which would be much bigger, and would make this 
    program much more complicated), we can't use some of the other algorithms, 
    like Ward's algorithm or the median or centroid algorithms.
